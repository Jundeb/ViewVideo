# Small 2 day project.

## Projects name: ViewVideo

## Link to app: https://proud-rock-03e39a603.2.azurestaticapps.net/

## API documentation (Swagger): https://viewvideoserver-aspnetserver.azurewebsites.net/index.html

## Projects idea
The idea was that the user can see the video if the license is not expired.
If license is expired, user needs to "buy" a new one. User can select the amount of "coins" that he/she wants to use and renew the license
aka. buy a new license. With 1 "coin" user gets a 1 minute license and for ex. 10 "coins" user gets a 10 minute license.
I did not have enough time to implement the timer for the app, without refreshing the page user can watch the video as long as wanted.
But if the user logs in and the license is expired video will not show.
